		<ul>
		  <li>Ensure that the image you use has a transparent background</li>
		  <li>If you use the <strong>media uploader</strong> link, remember that it will open in a new tag or window</li>
		  <li>After you have uploaded the image, copy the <strong>URL</strong> of the image in the<em> media uploader</em> window:</li>
		</ul>
		<p><img src="assets/media_uploader.jpg" width="450" height="420" alt="media uploader" /></p>

	<div class = "indent">
		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_2_theme_style_display.jpg" width="502" height="322" alt="theme style and display" /><br />
		<span class="figure">[fig. 2.2 Theme Style and Display]</span></p>
		<p><strong>Select a style:</strong><br />
		There are three different styles to choose from: <strong>Green</strong>, <strong>Brown and Green</strong> and <strong>Teal</strong>. Each has its own set of colors and images. This will change the entire look of the site.</p>
		<p><strong>Select a font style:</strong><br />
		There are also four different font styles: <strong>Helvetica</strong>, <strong>Yanonne Kaffeesatz and Trebuchet</strong>, <strong>Museu Slab and Lucida Grande or Verdana</strong>, and <strong>Chunk Five and Georgia</strong>. Each of these font configurations is different, and you can mix and match them with the different styles above to create a totally unique look to your preference. Each of the fonts is loaded in the theme, so it doesn't matter if visitors have those fonts installed in their computers or not- they will display as listed. </p>
		<p><strong>Blog Entries:</strong><br />
		  If you want to have blog entries displayed on the home page, you can click this box. Some users choose not to have their blog entries show up on their home page, opting for a smaller screen size with less scrolling on the home page. Others want the blog. It's your choice.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Blog Entry Dates:</strong><br />
		  Some users may not want to display the date on the blog entries because they do not update them very often, or they just choose not to have them. Check the box to display the date on your entries. Uncheck it to remove the date.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Number of Columns:</strong><br />
		You may have <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong> or <strong>three columns</strong> for your blog and sidebar on the home page. Remember, if you choose one column, your sidebars display underneath your blog, and if you choose two columns, your sidebars are stacked upon each other. </p>

		<p><img src="assets/backend_main_5_rotating_slider.jpg" width="523" height="110" alt="rotating slider" /><br />

Once uploaded, choose <em>Use as Featured Image</em> and your image will be set for that slider post.</p>
		<p><img src="assets/sliderpost.jpg" width="450" height="408" alt="slider post" /></p>
		<p>Each of these settings corresponds to elements in the slider.</p>
		<p>For each slider post that you enter, each of them will rotate automatically for the user. If you only upload one slider post, it will remain static. To manage your slider posts, go to <strong>Stimulus Slider</strong> under the<em> Stimulus Slider</em> dashboard menu item.</p>

	<h4 id = "widgets">2.6 Widgets <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>

	<p>Under <em>Appearance</em> in the dashboard menu, you can customize your widgets by choosing <strong>Widgets</strong>. There are 4 areas you can drag widgets to where they will show in the theme: <strong>Homepage Widgets</strong>, <strong>Sidebar 1</strong>, <strong>Sidebar 2</strong> and <strong>Footer Widgets</strong>.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Homepage Widgets</strong>: these three widgets will show up right below your featured text area</li>
	    <li><strong>Sidebar 1</strong> and <strong>Sidebar 2</strong>: These show up on your home page. Depending on how many columns you choose these will either show up under your blog (one column), to the right of the blog stacked upon each other (two column) or to the right of your blog as columns 2 and 3.</li>
	    <li><strong>Footer Widgets</strong>: these are the 3 widgets that will show up above your footer.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>If you are unfamiliar with using Widgets, you can learn more about it in the WordPress codex, found here: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets</a></p>
  </div>
	
	<h4 id = "menus">2.7 Menus &amp; Navigation <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
	<div class = "indent">
		<p>This theme utilizes a feature first introduced in Wordpress 3.0: Custom Menus. If you are unfamiliar with custom menus, you can learn more at <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_SubPanel" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_SubPanel</a></p>
<p><img src="assets/backend_main_7_menus_navigation.jpg" width="521" height="112" alt="menus &amp; navigation" /><br />
		  <span class="figure">[fig. 2.7 Menus &amp; Navigation]</span></p>
		<p>Your menu shows up in the header of your site. If you choose Configure here under menus, or whether you choose Menus under the Appearance section of your dashboard menu, you will be taken to a page to customize your menu. In order to have your menus displayed, make sure you create your custom menu, and then choose that menu in the Stimulus Main Navigation dropdown in the Theme Locations setting of the Menus page:</p>
		<p><img src="assets/menu_options.jpg" width="291" height="184" alt="menu locations" /></p>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Stimulus Main Navigation:</strong> This shows up below the top navigation</li>
		</ul>
	
  </div>
	
  <h4 id = "blog">2.8 Creating a &quot;Blog&quot; Page Sep<a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a>arate from the Index Page</h4>
		<p>Natively, the Green Stimulus offers you two options for displaying your blog posts. You can either choose your posts to show up on your home page, or you can choose to hide that section.</p>
		<p>If you do use blog posts, and you would like to have your blog listed in your navigation on a separate page of your website, follow the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Create a page on your website named &quot;Blog&quot; or whatever you would like to call it.</li>
		  <li>In the menu options for that page, choose <strong>&quot;Blog Page&quot;</strong> from the dropdown menu under <strong>Page Attributes &gt;&gt; Template</strong>.</li>
		  <li>Add this new page to one of your menus</li>
	  </ol>
		<p>Your blog posts will now be displayed on the page that you created. You still have the choice to display them on your home page or not.</p>
        
      <h4 id = "featuredimage">2.9 Using Featured Images in your Blog Posts</h4>
		<p>Want to display images in your blog archives? The Green Stimulus theme is designed to display featured images at the top of your excerpts on the blog archives, as well as at the top of the blog posts.</p>
		<p><img src="assets/featuredimage_600px.jpg" width="600" height="259" alt="Featured Image" /></p>
  <p>In order to display featured images, you will need to utilize Wordpress's Featured Image feature, housed within the menu on every blog page.</p>
		<p><img src="assets/featuredimage_backend.jpg" width="600" height="505" alt="featured image" /></p>
		<p>When you use the featured image from within a blog post, it will crop your image to the appropriate size and save additional thumbnail sizes. Whenever you change the number of columns you use, the theme will use the appropriately sized image, so that it always matches the theme design.</p>
		<p>If you would also like to use the full-sized version of your image, you may upload it to the content of your blog post.</p>
</div>
        
	<h3 id = "advanced">3.0 Advanced Customization <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h3>
	<div class = "indent">
		<h4 id = "customcss">3.1 Custom CSS <a class = "top" href = "#toc">[ top ]</a></h4>
		<p>If you would like to change the design of this theme, you just have to find the element's class or id and you can define your own styles within the <strong>custom.css</strong> file located in the theme's directory. This stylesheet is blank by default and is loaded last so any changes here will override what we have provided.</p>
		<p>A basic example would be if you wanted to style all the H3 tags to be blue. You would add <span style = "font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">h3 { color: blue; }</span> to <strong>custom.css</strong> and all the H3 tags will now be blue.
